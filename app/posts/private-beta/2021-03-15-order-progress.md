<p>
When a defendant appearing in court is currently supervised by probation, the magistrates or district judge will ask the probation service to give them information about how that person is responding to supervision. 

Probation practitioners in court usually contact the person’s probation manager in the community to get firsthand information about how the person is engaging. This includes whether they are attending appointments and if there are any significant changes to that person’s circumstances, such as their housing or employment situation. 

However, if the case is heard at short notice or if they are unable to speak to the person’s manager in the community, the probation practitioner in court will rely on attendance information that has been recorded in the probation database, NDelius. 

They will use this information, alongside any notes logged on NDelius by the probation manager, to build a picture of how a person is doing and relay this to the court.

 As a probation practitioner,
I need to know whether a defendant is attending their appointments,
So I can tell the court if they are engaging with probation
