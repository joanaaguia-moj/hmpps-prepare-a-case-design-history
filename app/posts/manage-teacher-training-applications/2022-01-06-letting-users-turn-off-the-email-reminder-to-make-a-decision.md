When we gave users the ability to [manage individual email notifications](/manage-teacher-training-applications/managing-individual-email-notifications), we did not include the reminder to make a decision 20 working days before automatic rejection.

We’ve now added the option to turn the reminder on or off.

## Future considerations

In future we want to consider:

- letting users choose when they will receive the reminder notification
- sending one email with multiple reminders for different applications
- sending a reminder to users 10 working days before automatic rejection if they only started with 20 working days
- changing the content of the email based on whether the user has permission to make offers and reject applications
