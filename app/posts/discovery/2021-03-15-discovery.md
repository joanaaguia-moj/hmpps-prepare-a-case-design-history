<h2>The Probation Service in magistrates’ courts </h2>

<p>Probation staff in magistrates’ courts are required to identify and provide information to the court about defendants who are currently or recently supervised by probation. They are also required to provide reports with recommendations for sentencing when a person has been found guilty of an offence. 

They currently struggle to do this in a timely fashion due to inefficiencies in the way cases are prepared and processed through court. This can result in avoidable adjournments in court and having to reduce the quality of reporting in order to meet deadlines.<p>

<h2>Who we spoke to</h2>

<p>During our discovery, we spoke to 34 staff across 12 courts in nine locations across England, including:


15 Court administrators
11 Probation officers / Probation services officers
8  Senior probation officers and senior administrators</p>

<h2>Our users</h2>
 
<b>Court administrators</b> who identify defendants known to probation and process cases out of court into the community. 

<b>Senior Court Administrators</b> who manage teams of administrators (often covering multiple sites).

<b>Probation Service Officers (PSOs) </b>, who take on preparing reports for low to medium risk cases. They also perform the role of Court Duty Officer where they advise court on cases and capture events in court relevant to a case.

<b>Probation Officers (POs)</b> who take on preparing reports for higher risk cases. 
  
<b>Senior Probation Officers (SPOs) </b>who manage probation officers in courts.




<h2>How courts currently prepare and manage cases in magistrates’ court</h2>

<p>Although the process differs slightly from court to court, it usually follows these steps:

<b>1. Court list for a day is printed</b>
A member of staff (usually an administrator) will access the court listing system, Libra, and print a copy of the court list for a particular day. The court list includes who is appearing and their personal details, the offence they’ve been charged with and when and where the case will be heard.

<b>2. Staff searches for defendant on probation database</b>
Staff then check the printed list and search for any defendants who have a record on the probation database, NDelius, by manually entering in the name, date of birth or Police National Computer (PNC) number of the defendant.

<b>3. Information gathered on the defendant from multiple sources </b>
When a defendant is found to have a probation record, the paper court list is annotated with the defendant’s probation status and their NDelius case reference number (CRN). Staff will then gather information on the defendant from NDelius and third parties such as the police, social services and drug or alcohol agencies.

<b>4. Probation practitioner contacted for update </b>
If a defendant is currently supervised by probation, staff in the court will request an update from their probation practitioner to understand their progress on an order. Requests can be sent via an NDelius contact, email or phone. The update is then relayed to the bench in court.

<b>5. Tracking sheet prepared with information about defendant and case </b>
A digital or paper tracking sheet is prepared with information about the defendant and case. This sheet will follow the case throughout the court journey. It will be updated with notes and information after each hearing and supports probation practitioners and administrators to complete tasks, such as creating an NDelius record for a new person, setting up a pre-sentence report or inputting information into NDelius after sentencing.</p>

<h2>Pain points</h2>

<p>There is significant pain in preparing and managing cases across the entire court journey due to usability issues with current software and reliance on paper processes. 

We identified these areas as major pain points:

<ul>
<li>Identifying defendants appearing in court who are known to probation due to the volume of cases and the repetitive and laborious manual nature of the task </li>

<li>Gathering information on current and previous orders for service users takes significant effort</li>

<li>Getting updates on people currently supervised by probation from from offender managers takes effort and the response rate is variable</li>
</ul> </p>

<h2>User needs</h2>

<p>Our discovery identified these three key user needs:</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  When planning court work, 
I need to segment users as not known, previous or current to probation
So I can prepare information for probation (service) officers
</div>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
When planning court work, 
I need to obtain all information relating to a current service user 
So the probation officer can focus on assessing them
</div>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
When preparing a case where the defendant is currently on probation
I need to assess their progress
So I can provide advice to court
</div>



<h2>Hypothesis</h2>

<p>Identifying cases of interest to probation and preparing them for court is crucial to providing advice to court and reducing adjournments, yet it is unnecessarily time consuming.

If we enable staff to more easily identify cases they’re interested in and gather information on those cases, we will save court staff time and effort and improve data quality on cases and service users.

This saved time and improved data quality will make better advice and reporting possible and help staff process cases on time while reducing unnecessary adjournments.</p>

<h2>Our riskiest assumptions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Automating the matching of defendants saves time and effort enabling ‘cases of interest to probation’ to be worked on more quickly</li>
<li>Gathering relevant information on a current or recently known user enables an officer to advise court and prepare a pre-sentence report more effectively</li>
<li>Creating a simpler, more usable way to solicit updates from offender managers and domestic violence logs from police, will improve advice to court & save time of court administrative staff and court duty officers</li>
</ol>


<h2>Plan for Alpha</h2>

<p>We will build an initial prototype to test our hypothesis and assumptions in relation to a minimum viable product that we could then take into Private Beta.

If our assumptions are correct, the service could be the basis for a new case preparation and processing service for probation staff in court.</p>
